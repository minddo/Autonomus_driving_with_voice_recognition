### Objective
The objectives of this project are as follow
1. deliver voice commands to the JetBot through voice recognition using ```snowboy```
2. collect and learn images through the JetBot to understand the context
3. execute the JetBot commands based on current context.

#### JetBot
JetBot is an open-source robot based on NVIDIA Jetson Nano that is
* Affordable - Less than $150 add-on to Jetson Nano
* Educational - Tutorials from basic motion to AI based collision avoidance
* Fun! - Interactively programmed from your web browser
